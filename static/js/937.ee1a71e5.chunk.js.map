This app helps me keep track of my inventory, the value of the inventory and where I had done the sales and dates. Specifically with TradeMe, it does not store data for very long so any user data like sold items or won items etc are not kept track of for more than a few months. It also does not have a way for me to check how much I have made in profit. Rather it only shows per sale. This along with using Facebook as my other primary source of trading I decided to make an app that encompasses what I had been doing with Excel spreadsheet which wasn’t very tidy looking. I wanted to make sure I could have a nice UI and UX so that it would not be cumbersome to use.`,\n      `I am looking into switching from React to React Native so that I can have the Sales Ledger on my mobile as I had already designed the Sales Ledger with mobile first in mind.\n    `,\n    ],\n    skills: `*React\n    *TypeScript\n    *JavaScript\n    *SQL Database(Knex)\n    *Express\n    *Superagent\n    *HTML\n    *Tailwind CSS\n    *Material Tailwind\n    *Toastify\n    `,\n    img: salesLedgerImg,\n    // link: 'https://github.com/samir-lekinwala/CineQueue',\n    youtubeLink: 'PfpudzcNp5M',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 3,\n    title: 'CineQueue',\n    category: 'UI/UX Design',\n    description: [\n      `This App was the final group project that was done during the DevAcademy bootcamp with 4 members in the team over 7 days.`,\n      `This app gave users the ability to add movies and tv shows to their watchlist, completed list, and see the runtime. It gave users options to choose content based on if they wanted to see TV Shows or Movies, the different genres within them and categories like upcoming and top rated. The key feature we had for our app was that you could see the entire runtime of a tv show and be able to change your availability in minutes per day. If you say for example only had 60 minutes to watch a show that was 40 hours long, it will take you 40 days to complete the series. We utilised the data from an API that was free to use and filtered based on data points we needed. Auth0 was also implemented so that each user could add content to their own watchlist and completed list.`,\n      `Recommendations were implemented based on the content clicked on and appeared at the bottom of the screen. There is also a search functionality within the app to search for your desired content.`,\n      `The idea came from combining different ideas together, one for recommendations and another for displaying time to watch a series and the idea of viewing the content.
