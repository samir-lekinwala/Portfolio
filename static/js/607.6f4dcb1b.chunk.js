It gave users options to choose content based on if they wanted to see TV Shows or Movies, the different genres within them and categories like upcoming and top rated. The key feature we had for our app was that you could see the entire runtime of a tv show and be able to change your availability in minutes per day. If you say for example only had 60 minutes to watch a show that was 40 hours long, it will take you 40 days to complete the series. We utilised the data from an API that was free to use and filtered based on data points we needed. Auth0 was also implemented so that each user could add content to their own watchlist and completed list.","Recommendations were implemented based on the content clicked on and appeared at the bottom of the screen. There is also a search functionality within the app to search for your desired content.","The idea came from combining different ideas together, one for recommendations and another for displaying time to watch a series and the idea of viewing the content. I personally was really wanting to create this app because I have a huge interest in movies and TV shows and wanted to have somewhere I could search and find the runtime of a show. This was a huge motivation for me to do this project.

This was at a point before we learned about SQL databases so as a substitute we used JSON data. It was a good learning opportunity. We wanted to make an app that could serve some real purpose in the real world. I believe we achieved this to some degree although it is a bit unpolished, the basic functionality is there.
